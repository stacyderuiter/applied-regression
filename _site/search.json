    "text": "Quarto (qmd) Files\n\nQuarto files are stand-alone!\nEvery Quarto file (qmd file) must be completely stand-alone. It doesn’t share any information with the Console or the Environment that you see in your RStudio session. All R code that you need to do whatever you are trying to do must be included in the qmd file itself!\nFor example, if you use the point-and-click user interface in the RStudio Environment tab to import a data file, that dataset will not be available when rendering your qmd file.\nSimilarly, if you load the mosaic package by typing in the Console window,\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nmosaic functions and data will not be available to use within the qmd file.\n\n\nSo: Keep your qmd files stand-alone! (You have no choice, actually…)\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Quarto file\nIn RStudio, navigate to File -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto Document…, or click on the white rectangle with a green circle+ :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand select Quarto from the drop-down menu.\nChoose html or pdf output.\n(Why not Word? Too much temptation to make changes and do formatting after the fact in Word…which makes your work no-longer-reproducible. In qmd, you have documented everything you’ve done. If you make changes after rendering to Word, that’s not true anymore.)\n\n\nSave your qmd file\nSave your file by clicking on the disk icon at the top of the file tab (give it a clear file name like deruiter_quarto_practice.qmd).\nDo your best to avoid spaces and special characters in your file names.\nThe file will be saved to the server, not to your computer. All your files will be accessible in the RStudio Files tab (lower right panel) whenever you log into RStudio, regardless of which computer you are using. You may organize them into directories (folders) if you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender!\nHow do qmd files actually work? What’s so cool about them?\nClick on the fat blue arrow next to the word “Render” at the top of the file window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the rendered html or pdf result, and compare it to the original Quarto file.\nWow!\n\n\nSource vs. Visual Editor\nLook to the upper right corner of your qmd file. You should see some buttons that allow you to toggle between “Source” and “Visual” editor modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your own file, toggle back and forth a few times. The Source mode lets you see (and type) the straight-up markdown – which is probably nice if you’re already used to it, and annoying or mystifying if not. The Visual mode is more of a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (like the rendered version), point-and-click type interface. You may use whichever you prefer.\n\n\nPersonalize your Markdown file\nAt the top of the Quarto file, there is a section called the “YAML header”. It starts and ends with 3 dashes - - -.\n\n\nIn this part of the file, be very careful what you type: a stray space or character will lead to an error.\n\n\nThis is where you can enter an appropriate title, author(s), and date (within the quotation marks). You can also choose the format you want to render to (usually pdf or html – not in quotes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize your YAML header in your own Quarto doc, and then render again to see the effect.\nMake sure you do this for every assignment! (No prof or boss likes getting submissions called “Untitled”…)",

    "text": "qmd file anatomy\n\nText\nThe Quarto file is where you save all the R commands you want to use, plus any text commenting on the work you are doing and the results you get. Parts of the file with a plain white background are normal text.\nYou can format the text. For example, enclosing a word in asterisks will generate italics, so *my text* in the qmd file will become my text in the PDF. Using two asterisks instead of one will generate boldface, so **my text** becomes my text. You can also make bulleted lists, numbered lists, section headers, and more. For example,\n#### Some Text\nbecomes\n\nSome Text\n(a sub-section header). Fewer hashtags make the text even larger, and more make it smaller.\nCaution! Forgetting the space after the last hashtag will format your text verbatim rather than as a header (#fail). Failing to leave a blank line before the header can also make formatting fail.\nCheck out the Quarto Markdown Basics reference at https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html for more examples of how to format text in Quarto.\nFor instructions on how to include R output and special characters (symbols, subscripts, etc.) in your text, see also: https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/STAT341/symbols/\nBefore moving on, try a few of the tricks you just learned in your qmd file. Make it pretty!\n\n\n\nqmd file anatomy: R code chunks\nAn qmd file can (of course!) contain one or more R code chunks. These sections of the file have a grey background onscreen. In Source mode, each one begins with\n```{r}\nand ends with\n```\nlike so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Visual mode you can’t see the `:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to add a new R code chunk to your file\nTo add a code chunk to your file in Source editor mode, you have three options.\n\nYou can type in the header and footer by hand to start and end the chunk.\nYou can click on the “add chunk” button at the top right. It’s a green box with the C inside (at the top of the qmd file; choose the first option, “R”, in the pulldown) to insert an empty chunk.\nYou can use a keyboard shortcut: Windows, Ctrl + Alt + I or OS X, Cmd + Option + I\n\nWhen you click the Render button, code in code chunks will be run, and any output will be included in the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Chunk\nConsider using the first R code chunk in a qmd file to specify settings (for graphics, display, etc.). In this chunk, you can also give R permission to use certain packages (software toolkits) with\n\nlibrary(packagename) \n\nFor example, we will use the ggformula package for graphics. So, verify that the first R code chunk in your file includes the line library(ggformula).\nYou can also specify options for each R code chunk - these go at the top, prefaced by #|. A typical setup chunk for our course might look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that several packages are loaded (that we will use frequently). theme_set() is used to specify some settings for graph output, and knitr::opts_chunk$set() is used to specify whether or not to include R code in the rendered file (Yes please: use echo: true!) and specify the default figure size.\nThere are tons more options and settings, and you can explore them at https://yihui.org/renderr/options/#chunk-options.\nBut for now, if you use something like the setup chunk shown above, it should work well and have what you need for almost all work in this course.\n\n\nThe settings chunk is invisible!\nIf you look carefully at the rendered output, you will see that the setup chunk does not appear there. That’s intentional - when you load packages with library(), they often print a lot of long and pretty useless messages, which you want to omit from your rendered document.\nThis is achieved by having the setting include: false\nHowever, for our course, no chunk other than the setup chunk should have the setting “include: false” (or echo: false for that matter). Generally, anyone evaluating your coursework needs to see all the code you used, not just its output.\n\n\nClean Up\nAt this point, you probably want to get rid of all the extra content in the template.\nIf you haven’t put a setup chunk into your own qmd file…do it now! Here’s another reminder of how it would look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, Delete everything in the file other than the YAML header and your setup R code chunk.\nNow the clutter is gone and you have space to include your own R code and text.\n(Before going further, make sure it still renders.)",

Which is preferable?\nI think PDFs are a little more portable and a good default option, and their formatting is best for anything you are going to print out or share via email (especially with less technically inclined folks).\nHowever, later in the semester we may see how to create some pretty cool interactive graphics and/or tables in R, and these can only be rendered in HTML. For this class, you may use either one. (But not Word, remember? Because you’ll lose reproducibility…)\n\n\nRunning R Code from a qmd file: Run Menu\nYou can also use shortcuts/buttons to run specific chunk(s). Here is one way to do it (option 1): Use the Run pulldown menu at the top of the file.

Instead of pointing and clicking, you will type one or more lines of code, which R will execute (doing the work you have asked it to do).\nThen, R will return the results of whatever operation you asked it to do - sometimes producing a plot, other times creating a plot.\nSometimes executing code has almost no visible effect (no plot or text output is produced), but instead some object is created and stored in R’s environment for later use.\n\nTwo Key Questions\nTo get R (or any software) to do something for you, there are two important questions you must be able to answer. Before continuing, think about what those questions might be.\n\n\nThe Questions\nTo get R (or any software) to do a job for you, there are two important questions you must be able to answer:\n\n1. What do you want the computer to do?\n\n\n2. What must the computer know in order to do that?\n\n\n\nProviding R with the information it needs\nR functions provide R with the answer to the first question: what do you want the computer to do?\nMost functions in R have short, but descriptive names that describe what they do. For example, R has some functions to do basic mathematical operations: the function sqrt() computes the square root of a number, and the function round() rounds a number (by default, it rounds to the nearest integer).\nBut just giving R a function is not enough: you also need to answer the second question (what information does R need to do the job?). For example, if you want to use the function round(), you also need to provide R with the number you want to round!\nWe will provide answers to our two questions by filling in the boxes of a basic template:\n\n\nfunction (  information1  ,  information2  , …)\n\n\n \n(The ... indicates that there may be some additional input arguments (input information we could provide to R) we could add eventually. Some functions need only one input, but if a function takes more than one argument, they are separated by commas. They have names, and if named (like: function(input_name = value, input2_name = 'value')) they can be in any order.\n\n\nUsing simple functions\nLet’s practice what you just learned, trying out the mathematical sqrt() and round() functions.\nEdit the code below to compute the square root of 64:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using the sqrt() function:\nsqrt(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input information that sqrt() needs to make your calculation is the number you want the square root of: 64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nsqrt(64)\n\n\n\n\nNow try computing the square root of 44, and then rounding it to the nearest integer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to use two functions this time:\nThe sqrt() function, and then the round() function.\nsqrt(___)\nround(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input information that sqrt() needs to make your calculation is the number you want the square root of: 44. Run that code first, to get the input you will need for round()…\nsqrt(44)\nround(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nsqrt(44)\nround(6.63325)\nCan you do it all in one go? Well…yes!\nround(sqrt(44))\nThere’s also an easier-to-read way to do that, using a pipe operator |&gt;. It takes the output of one operation and passes it as input to the next. You can read it as |&gt; = “and then…” so we could do:\nsqrt(44) |&gt;\n  round()\n\nTake the square root of 44, and then\nround the result.\n\n(More on pipes later!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring information in R: variables\nIn the last section, you computed the square root of 44 and then rounded it, perhaps like this:\n\nsqrt(44)\n\n[1] 6.63325\n\nround(6.63325)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nBut to do that, you probably had to first find the root, make a note of the result, and then provide that number to the round function. What a pain!\nA very useful option, if you have value (or a variable, dataset, or other R object) that you will want to use later on, is to store it as a named object in R. In the previous example, you might want to store the square root of 44 in a variable called my_root; then you can provide my_root to the round() function without checking the result of the sqrt() calculation first:\n\nmy_root &lt;- sqrt(44)\nround(my_root)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nNotice that to assign a name to the results of some R code, you use the symbol &lt;-. You can think of it as an assignment arrow – it points from a value or item toward a name and assigns the name to the thing.\nTry editing the code to change the name of the variable from my_root to something else, then run your new code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you change the name my_root in both places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_new_name &lt;- sqrt(44)\nround(your_new_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a list of numbers to store?\nSometime you might want to create a variable that contains more than one number. You can use the function c() to concatenate a list of numbers:\n\nmy_fave_numbers &lt;- c(4, 44, 16)\nmy_fave_numbers\n\n[1]  4 44 16\n\n\n(First we stored the list of numbers, calling it my_fave_numbers; then we printed the results to the screen by simply typing the variable name my_fave_numbers).\nTry making a list of your three favorite numbers, then using the function sum to add them all up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst use c() to concatenate your chosen numbers (separated by commas).\nDon’t forget to use &lt;- to assign your list of numbers a name!\nThen, use sum() to add them up.\nmy_numbers &lt;- c(___,___,___)\nsum(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one possible solution.\nmy_numbers &lt;- c(4, 16, 44)\nsum(my_numbers)\nNotice you could also nest sum() and c(), or use the pipe operator |&gt; to calculate the numeric answer, but then you would not have the object my_numbers available for later use…\nsum(c(4, 16, 44))\n# or \nc(4, 16, 44) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about data that are not numeric?\nR can work with categorical data as well as numeric data. For example, we could create a list of words and store it as a variable if we wanted (feel free to try changing the words if you want):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a LOT more data to store?\nc() works great for creating small lists of just a few values, but it is not a good way to enter or store large data tables - there is lots of potential for user error. In this course, you will usually be given a dataset already in electronic form; if you need to create one, you would turn to spreadsheet or database software. Either way you read the existing data file into R directly.\nIn R, these larger datasets are stored as objects called data.frames. The next sections will get you started using them.",

    "text": "Using built-in datasets in R\nR has a number of built-in datasets that are accessible to you as soon as you start RStudio.\nIn addition to the datasets that are included with base R, there are add-on packages for R that contain additional software tools and sometimes datasets.\nTo use datasets contained in a package, you have to load the package by running the command:\n\nlibrary(packagename) \n\n\nExample of loading a package\nFor example, we will practice looking at a dataset from the package mosaic.\nBefore we can access the data, we have to load the package. The code might look like this:\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n(Nothing obvious will happen when you run this code…it basically just gives R permission to access the package, so there is often no output visible.)\n\n\nViewing a dataset\nThe mosaic package includes a dataset called HELPrct.\nIf you just run the dataset name (HELPrct) as a command, R will print some (or all - egad!) of the dataset out to the screen! (So don’t…)\nBut…how can we extract selected, useful information about a dataset?\n\n\nGathering information about a dataset\nThere are a few functions that make it easier to take a quick look at a dataset:\n\nhead() prints out the first few rows of the dataset.\nnames() prints out the names of the variables (columns) in the dataset\ndplyr::glimpse() (function glimpse() from package dplyr) gives an short list-like overview of the dataset\nskimr::skim() (function skim() from the package skimr) prints out more detailed graphical summary information about a dataset\nnrow() reports the number of rows (observations or cases) in the dataset\nncol() reports the number of columns (variables) in the dataset\n\nTry applying each of these functions to the HELPrct data and see what the output looks like each time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for each of the functions is the name of the dataset: HELPrct.\nhead(HELPrct)\nnames(HELPrct)\nnrow(HELPrct)\nncol(HELPrct)\nskimr::skim(HELPrct)\ndplyr::glimpse(HELPrct)\nIn this case, the point is usually to view the information on-screen, not to store it for later use, so we have not used &lt;- at all to store any output for later use or reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting more help\nYou can get help related to R function, and built-in R datasets, using a special function: ?.

    "section": "Reading in data from a file",
    "text": "Reading in data from a file\nFor this class, you will often be asked to analyze data that is stored in files that are available online - usually in csv format. It’s simple to read them into R. For example, we can read in the file MI_lead.csv, which is stored at https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv using the function read_csv() (from package readr or super-package tidyverse):\n\nlibrary(readr) # the readr package contains the read_csv() function\nMI_lead &lt;- read_csv(file = 'https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv')\n\nRows: 83 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): County, Peninsula, RandomRetest\ndbl (4): ELL2005, ELL2012, Difference, PropPre1950\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\nThe most common mistakes\nThe code below contains several of the most common mistakes students make when they try to read in a data file. See if you can find and correct them all!\nThe code below - if corrected - would (on our server or in standalone R) run without an error and read in some baseball statistics from the file http://stacyderuiter.github.io/teachingdata/data-raw/baseball.csv.\nHere in this tutorial, it may give the error: ! curl package not installed, falling back to using url() – there’s not a straightforward fix, sorry, but try it on the server if you want to prove to yourself that it works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nIs the filename or URL spelled correctly, with no typos?\nIs the filename or URL in quotation marks (either ” or ’ work equally)?\nIs the URL complete (including the file extension “.csv”)\nWas &lt;- used to assign a name to the dataset once read in? (Otherwise it will just be uselessly printed to the screen and not available for later use!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nbaseball_data &lt;- read_csv(file = 'http://stacyderuiter.github.io/teachingdata/data-raw/baseball.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about local files?\nThe same function, read_csv(), can be used to read in a local file. You just need to change the input to read_csv() – instead of a URL, you provide a path and filename (in quotes). For example, the input file = 'https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv' might become file = 'C:\\\\Data\\\\MI_lead.csv'.\nWe won’t do an example in this tutorial because it’s not straightforward to work with local files within a tutorial environment, but you can practice it once you are working independently in RStudio.\nIf you are working on the server r.cs.calvin.edu, you will have to upload files to your cloud space on the server before you can read them in (RStudio on the server cannot access files on your computer’s hard drive). Look in the “Files” tab on the lower right, and then click “Upload.”\n\n\nNamed input arguments\nThe input argument we provided to R is the URL (in quotes – either single or double quotes are fine). But notice that this time, we gave the input argument a name, “file”, and specified its value with an equal sign.\nThis is not required - the command works fine without it:\n\nMI_lead &lt;- read_csv('https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv')\n\nRows: 83 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): County, Peninsula, RandomRetest\ndbl (4): ELL2005, ELL2012, Difference, PropPre1950\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nHowever, if a function has more than just one input argument, it’s good to get in the habit of providing names for the inputs. If you provide names, then the order in which you list the inputs doesn’t matter; without names, the order matters and you have to use ? to figure out what order R expects!\n\n\nRenaming variables in a dataset\nThis is an advanced topic, so don’t worry if it seems complicated; for now, it just nice to realize some of the power R has to clean up and reorganize data.\nWhat if we didn’t like the names of the MI_lead variables? For example, a new user of the dataset might not know that that ELL stands for “elevated lead levels” and that ELL2005 gives the proportion of tested kids who had elevated lead levels in the year 2005.\nIf we wanted to use a clearer (though longer) variable name, we might prefer “prop_elevated_lead_2005” instead of “ELL2005” – more letters to type, but a bit easier to understand for a new user. How can we tell R we want to rename a variable?\nWe use the code:\n\nMI_lead &lt;- MI_lead |&gt;\n  rename(prop_elevated_lead_2005 = ELL2005)\n\nglimpse(MI_lead)\n\nThe code above uses some tools you’ve seen, and some more advanced ones you haven’t seen yet. The symbol |&gt; is called a “pipe” and basically means “and then…” Translated into words, the code above tells R:\n\nMake a dataset called MI_lead by starting with the dataset MI_lead.\nNext, take the results do something more with them (|&gt;) …\nrename() a variable. What I want to rename is the variable ELL2005. Its new name should be prop_elevated_lead_2005.”\n\nSee…you can already start to make sense of even some pretty complicated (and useful) code.\nNote: If you give R several commands, not connected by pipes, it will do the first, then the second, then the third, and so on. R doesn’t need the pipe for permission to continue! Instead, the pipe tells R to take the results from the first command, and use them as the input or starting material for the next command.\n\n\nCheck out the data\nOK, back to business - simple functions and datasets in R.\nIt’s your turn to practice now. Use one of the functions you have learned so far to extract some information about the MI_lead dataset.\nHow many rows are in the dataset? How many variables (columns)?\nWhat are the variables named, and what are their values like?\nRemember, ? won’t work on MI_lead because it’s not a built-in R dataset. The dataset MI_lead is already read in for you, here…so you don’t need to use read_csv().",

    "text": "Text and Code in Quarto\n\nText\nThe Quarto file is where you save all the R commands you want to use, plus any text commenting on the work you are doing and the results you get. Parts of the file with a plain white background are normal text.\nYou can format the text. For example, enclosing a word in asterisks will generate italics, so *my text* in the qmd file will become my text in the PDF. Using two asterisks instead of one will generate boldface, so **my text** becomes my text. You can also make bulleted lists, numbered lists, section headers, and more. For example,\n#### Some Text\nbecomes\n\nSome Text\n(a sub-section header). Fewer hashtags make the text even larger, and more make it smaller.\nCaution! Forgetting the space after the last hashtag will format your text verbatim rather than as a header (#fail). Failing to leave a blank line before the header can also make formatting fail.\nCheck out the Quarto Markdown Basics reference at https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html for more examples of how to format text in Quarto.\nFor instructions on how to include R output and special characters (symbols, subscripts, etc.) in your text, see also: https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/STAT341/symbols/\nBefore moving on, try a few of the tricks you just learned in your qmd file. Make it pretty!\n\n\n\nqmd file anatomy: R code chunks\nAn qmd file can (of course!) contain one or more R code chunks. These sections of the file have a grey background onscreen. In Source mode, each one begins with\n```{r}\nand ends with\n```\nlike so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Visual mode you can’t see the `:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to add a new R code chunk to your file\nTo add a code chunk to your file in Source editor mode, you have three options.\n\nYou can type in the header and footer by hand to start and end the chunk.\nYou can click on the “add chunk” button at the top right. It’s a green box with the C inside (at the top of the qmd file; choose the first option, “R”, in the pulldown) to insert an empty chunk.\nYou can use a keyboard shortcut: Windows, Ctrl + Alt + I or OS X, Cmd + Option + I\n\nWhen you click the Render button, code in code chunks will be run, and any output will be included in the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Chunk\nConsider using the first R code chunk in a qmd file to specify settings (for graphics, display, etc.). In this chunk, you can also give R permission to use certain packages (software toolkits) with\n\nlibrary(packagename) \n\nFor example, we will use the ggformula package for graphics. So, verify that the first R code chunk in your file includes the line library(ggformula).\nYou can also specify options for each R code chunk - these go at the top, prefaced by #|. A typical setup chunk for our course might look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that several packages are loaded (that we will use frequently). theme_set() is used to specify some settings for graph output, and knitr::opts_chunk$set() is used to specify whether or not to include R code in the rendered file (Yes please: use echo: true!) and specify the default figure size.\nThere are tons more options and settings, and you can explore them at https://yihui.org/renderr/options/#chunk-options.\nBut for now, if you use something like the setup chunk shown above, it should work well and have what you need for almost all work in this course.\n\n\nThe settings chunk is invisible!\nIf you look carefully at the rendered output, you will see that the setup chunk does not appear there. That’s intentional - when you load packages with library(), they often print a lot of long and pretty useless messages, which you want to omit from your rendered document.\nThis is achieved by having the setting include: false\nHowever, for our course, no chunk other than the setup chunk should have the setting “include: false” (or echo: false for that matter). Generally, anyone evaluating your coursework needs to see all the code you used, not just its output.\n\n\nClean Up\nAt this point, you probably want to get rid of all the extra content in the template.\nIf you haven’t put a setup chunk into your own qmd file…do it now! Here’s another reminder of how it would look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, Delete everything in the file other than the YAML header and your setup R code chunk.\nNow the clutter is gone and you have space to include your own R code and text.\n(Before going further, make sure it still renders.)",

For this class, you may use either one. (But not Word, remember? Because you’ll lose reproducibility…)\n\n\nRunning R Code from a qmd file: Run Menu\nYou can also use shortcuts/buttons to run specific chunk(s). Here is one way to do it (option 1): Use the Run pulldown menu at the top of the file. (Choose the option you want based on what you are trying to do).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Code from a qmd file: Shortcut Button\nHere is another way to use shortcuts/buttons to run only a specific chunk (option 2): Click on the green arrow at the upper right of a code chunk to run the chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Code from a qmd file: Copy and Paste\nFinally, here’s a third way to use shortcuts/buttons (option 3):\nCopy the code you want to run, paste to the console window, and hit Enter.\n(Or, place your cursor in the line you want to run and hit ctrl + enter (Windows) or cmd + enter (Mac).)",

    "text": "Bye, Junk!\nOur first principle is: if it doesn’t need to be in your graph, it shouldn’t be there. Keep things as simple as possible. What are some justifications for a need to include an element in a plot?\n\nIt is crucial to the story you are telling, or the research question you are answering.\nIt emphasizes your main point. For example, some plots may not need color, and in others it may add crucial visual contrast to highlight a main point.\nIt makes the graph easier to read and understand\nIt makes the main message of the graph more memorable\n\nIf you need it, include it, but if not, keep it simple!\nImagine you are using very expensive ink to print every element of the graph. Is every drop of in you’re using really worth it? If not, take it out. As influential data visualization thinker Edward Tufte put it in The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,\n\nA large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data change. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic…\n\nIn other words, don’t let annotations, labels, grids, etc. overwhelm the visual impact of your data – Don’t do this:\n\nCartoon source: https://freshspectrum.com/data-ink-ratio/\n\nCheck: Critique the Pie\nThe figure below, from a Forbes article on mobile operating system crashes, is pretty awful.\n\nWhat is one main conclusion from the graph above? (It’s pretty confusing to interpret, so you may have to study carefully to find something…)\nNow that you have identified one main conclusion from the graph, what is one element of the plot that obscures that conclusion, is NOT necessary, and could be removed to improve the plot? Answer constructively - as if the person who made the plot was incredibly smart and someone you admire, and to whom you wanted to be kind but helpful.",

    "text": "Proportional Ink and Axis Scales\nFor bar graphs and other filled-area plots, the area of a graphic element should correspond to the proportion of the data it represents.\nThis principle might be violated if the lower limit of a count/frequency axis is not 0. If you’re showing the number or proportion or percentage of observations in categories, it’s usually best to set the lower limit of the axis to 0.\nIf you don’t start at 0, make sure the “at a glance” interpretation of your figure is not misleading!\nA similar principle applies for plots of quantitative variables if they use filled areas to represent numeric values and there is some value (zero or another threshold value) that is an important reference point.\nFor optional additional detail on choosing honest axis limits and more examples, check out the blog post by the excellent but (sorry) profanely named Calling B*** project.\nAn example from Chapter 17 of C. Wilke’s *Fundamentals of Data Visualization shows the “Stock price of Facebook (FB) from Oct. 22, 2016 to Jan. 21, 2017”:\n\n\nWhy is the Facebook figure above ‘bad’? Mark all correct answers as TRUE.\nThe graph suggests that Facebook stock value dropped dramatically around November 1, 2016. But it actually only lost about 10% of its value. TRUEFALSE\nThe grey area should be plain white, not colored in. TRUEFALSE\nThe stock price values appear too jagged and should be smoothed out. TRUEFALSE\nThere are some stock price values that appear to be outliers and should be removed. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solutions above.\n\n\nIn this case, it would probably be less misleading to use a y axis ranging from 0 to 135 instead of 110 to 135.\nA line chart could also be used here (without filling in the grey area), but using the color emphasizes the values rather than the trend over time.\nWe can not just change data values to make them look how we like. If we wanted to emphasize the smoothed trend over time, we could show the smoothed curve atop a scatter plot of the original data points, which would present the desired message without altering the data. If we did average over time before plotting, it should be clearly noted (for example, “Weekly average Facebook stock prices…”).\nEven if there are outliers (there are not extreme ones here), it is only acceptable to exclude them from analysis if you can verify that they are errors.\n\n\nConsider two ways to try to “fix” the figure (again from Wilke).\n\nA.\n\n\n\nB.\n\n\nWhy is the Facebook figure above ‘bad’? Mark all correct answers as TRUE.\nWhich of the figures above solves the proportional-ink problem with the Facebook stock price plot?\n\nA does it! TRUEFALSE\nB does it! TRUEFALSE\nActually maybe both of them do it…TRUEFALSE\nNeither of them solves the problem. TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solutions above.\n\nA accurately shows the reduction in stock price as a proportion of the initial price. But what about B? Some would say B accurately shows the amount of value lost (and then regained) over time. Others would argue that it is as bad as the original, for similar reasons - the graph shows the absolute lost value, not the proportion lost value. So B may be OK, or bad, depending on your perspective.\nSome would say B accurately shows the amount of value lost (and then regained) over time. Others would argue that it is as bad as the original, for similar reasons - the graph shows the absolute lost value, not the proportion lost value.\n\n\n\nCounts or Proportions or Percentages?\n\nFor categorical data, should you show the Count in each category, or the Frequency (proportion or percent)? It depends!\n\nWhen you want to compare by category across groups, and the total number in each group varies, frequency works well\nIf representing differences in sample size between groups is crucial, counts work better",

Make sure no unneccessary text is included.\n\nDefault size of text in figures produced by statistical software is almost always too small. Make sure your text is big enough to be easily legible in the context where you will present it (on the page in a report, on a slide for a presentation, etc.)\nOther than the title of the vertical (y) axis, all the text in a plot should be horizontal. This makes it easier to read.\nAxis labels should be self-explanatory\n\nViewers should be able to guess what they mean accurately without looking at anything but the figure\nUse words instead of numeric codes or cryptic abbreviations\n\nAxis labels should also be as short as possible while remaining easy to understand\nEvery plot should have a title. Sometimes this might be a literal title at the top of the graph, but those are relatively rare. More often in scientific work, a text caption appears below the figure. The first phrase/sentence of the caption acts as the figure’s title\n\nRemember the melanoma rates over time figure from the last section?\n\n\nWhat helpful changes did Storytelling with Data make to the text labels as they improved the figure?\nThe x axis labels are rotated so they are horizonal.

TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solutions above.\n\n\nRotating axis labels so they are horizontal is generally an improvement. To make this happen, the number of tick marks and labels on the x axis was also reduced. Notice the labels are much easier to read.\nThe color changes helped too. The blue links the title with the trend it describes, and the grey makes the axis titles less prominent and lets the viewer focus on the data. Continue to the next section for more on using color…\nThe box is gone, and it is a big improvement to the plot! But technically, you were asked about changes to the text labels…",

Two easy solutions, in order of preference, are to switch x and y coordinates so the “long” labels are on the y axis (in R, this resizes the plot area so that labels fit); or, to rotate the too-long labels, which eliminates the overlap but makes them harder to read than horizontal text.\nSometimes a title or axis label is too long and runs off the edge of the figure. Using a smaller font is not often an ideal solution. If you can’t just use a shorter label, consider adding line breaks.",

Not sure? Find a number of bins that is definitely too few, and one that is definitely too many, and then try to settle on an in-between value that best shows the real shape of the distribution without over-smoothing.\n\n\n\nDensity Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a smoothed version of a histogram (obtained by kernel density estimation, if you want to look up mathematical details)\nCaution: for small datasets, the density plot may show “peaks” that really correspond to one or a few observations\nCan only show density (relative frequency of observation), not counts\n\n\n\nQQ Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Q-Q Plot” is short for “Quantile-Quantile Plot”\nIn some cases, we want to examine the shape of a variable’s distribution to see if it matches a theoretical expectation.

(If that example doesn’t make sense to you now - it will later in the course, don’t worry.)\nQuantile-quantile plots are one way to make this comparison. They plot the quantiles of the data as a function of the same quantiles of the expected theoretical distribution; if there’s a good match, the points should follow a line with slope = 1.\nHow close to the straight line is “close enough”?

    "text": "Background\n\nWhat’s a “graph”?\nA note about vocabulary: in this course, when we say “visualization” or “graph” or “plot” we mean a picture displaying data.\nSpreadsheets and tables presenting data are not included - If you are asked to “produce a graph” or “create a visualization” a table of summary statistics is not generally a desirable response.\nTables are not unimportant; they just don’t count, to us, as graphs, plots, or visualizations.\nOften a table might accompany a visualization, for additional reference and numeric values to cite…but we’d argue that it’s usually the picture that is memorable, and that tells the story.\n\n\nLibraries\nThere are many ways to generate graphics in R. Some popular packages for visualization in R include graphics (which is included in the most basic R installation) and ggplot2. If you don’t know any of those yet, don’t worry a bit (and maybe continue right to the next section). If you do know one of those other systems, read on…\nIn this course we will use ggformula, which is built on top of ggplot2 (so the graphs you create will be ggplot objects and can be modified as such). However, the syntax ggformula uses to specify input variables and settings is a bit different than ggplot2. The differences are desirable to us because:\n\nWe like consistency: ggformula input syntax is more like that of the functions we’ll be using to fit models to data\nWe often create graphics with several layers: Overlaying one graph on top of another is a bit easier in ggformula than in ggplot\n\nBecause of the variety of graphics packages in use in the R ecosystem, it is highly recommended that you not do a web search to find code examples to produce a certain graph. This section, course notes, and other course materials should have all the examples that you need (and if not, request additions!). In particular, mixing together code from different graphics packages generally leads to confusing disasters.\n\n\nMotivation: Realize the Dream!\nFigures are a crucial tool for exploring your data and communicating what you learn from the data.\nWhether you are doing a quick check to assess basic features of a dataset or creating a key figure for an important presentation, the best practice is to work thoughtfully. You already learned about creating graphics by I.C.E.E:\n\nThe I.C.E.E. method:\n\nImagine how you want your graph to look, before you\nCode. Once you have the basic starting point,\nEvaluate your work, and\nElaborate (refine it).\n\nRepeat until the figure is as awesome as it needs to be.\nWhat’s the missing piece that we left for last? That’s right: the code. Not most important, but crucial.\nSpecifically, you will now focus on implementation – you have a plan in mind; now how can you do it in R?\nThis section provides a set of code examples and practice exercises, but leaves out the details of design already covered in previous sections. Here, the assumption is you know what you want, and just need the technique to create it.\nTreat this section like a reference manual: it’s more important that you know how to look stuff up here than that you spend lots of time on every topic, and you don’t need to memorize. Complete the first 4 sections if you are new to ggformula, and then refer to the others as needed and as time allows. Get used to using this site as a “manual” to look stuff up on demand.\nGraph types marked with an (o) and with their section header in italics are ones that are optional and/or more advanced - skip if you wish.",

Formulas in R always involve the tilde character, which is easy to overlook. It looks like this:\n \n\n\n  ~  \n\n\n \nMake sure you know where the tilde is located on your computer’s keyboard! It is often near the upper left-hand corner on US keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula shapes\nMost gf_ functions take a formula that describes the positional attributes of the plot. Using one of these functions with no arguments will show you the “shape” of the formula it requires.\n\n\nGetting help on formula shapes\nRun this code to see the formula shape for gf_point().\n\n\ngf_point() uses \n    * a formula with shape y ~ x. \n    * geom:  point \n    * key attributes:  alpha, color, size, shape, fill, group, stroke\n\nFor more information, try ?gf_point\n\n\nYou should see that gf_point()’s formula has the shape y ~ x, so the y-variable name goes before the tilde and the x-variable name goes after. (Think: “y depends on x”. Another way to remember the order is y ~ x: the y-axis label appears farther left than the x-axis label.)\n\n\nOrder matters in formulas!\nReverse the roles of the variables, changing births ~ date to date ~ births. How does the plot change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces\n\n\nSize Matters\nWhat is the largest key on your keyboard?\n\n return/enter caps lock delete the space bar the arrow keys\n\n\n\nUmm…so why did I ask you that?\n\nMaybe there is a reason that the space bar key is biggest – you should use it a lot!.\n\n\n\nR, People, and Spaces\nR is not very picky about spaces.\n\nAny number of spaces is equivalent to a single space.\nSometimes (but not always) spaces are optional.\n\nMy advice is to use spaces liberally. Even if R doesn’t care, it makes your code easier for people to read.\n\nAlways put a space around things like +, *, ~ etc. (This is a place where R doesn’t care whether you have a space or not, but I recommend you do.)\nAlways put a space after each comma\nNever put a space between a function name and its parentheses (write head(data) not head (data))\nUse spaces and line breaks to make your code easy to read.\n\nMimic the examples you see in this section. And if you want a more comprehensive code style guide for R, check out the tidyverse style guide.\nBonus points if you point out my own style inconsistencies to me so I can correct them!",

We will learn more about this kind of data wrangling later.\nHere, we want to group_by() the variable that defines the groups, and then summarize() within each group by computing the number of observations n() or the proportion or percentage of interest. Finally, always ungroup() at the end. Let’s try it with the mmr data.\nNote that I’m intentionally showing you how to do this for proportions / categorical variables and not for means of quantitative variables!\nThere’s a reason for that. Our best practice is the show all the data as much as we can. For more on why, see Bang goes the detonator plot!",

This works much like gf_facet_wrap() and accepts a formula with one of three shapes:\n\ny ~ x (facets along both axes)\n~ x (facets only along x-axis)\ny ~ .
