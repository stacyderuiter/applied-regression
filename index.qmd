This site provides tutorials and reference guides introducing:

-    using R/RStudio for reproducible research with Quarto,

-   data visualization with `ggformula` (`ggplot`?)

-   linear regression models

Throughout the website, you'll find "webr" code blocks like below.

These code examples are live. You can edit the code and run it to practice and experiment.

::: {your-turn}
Give it a try. Run the code below to calculate `1 + 1`. Then see if you can get R to compute the product 3 \* 5 in the code block below.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1_r
1 + 1

```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1_r
#| check: true
results <- Filter(\(x) inherits(x, "result"), .evaluate_result)
if(is.null(Find(\(x) x$value == 15, results))) {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = "Now see if you can compute 3 * 5.")
} else {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = "Correct!")
}
```
